RB Rankings: The Top 53 Running Back Prospects  
My rankings are based on a combination of the data I collected from studying games, my view of a player’s potential fit with 
any offensive system, and his potential for growth. In addition to rankings and comparisons tables that supply short 
summaries, I am leading with more detailed written summaries of each runner, so you don’t have to hunt through the raw 
reports in the back of the publication.  
 
This list does not include all backs that might have the skills to make it in the league. I don’t always have the resources to 
watch every eligible prospect for this publication date. I will likely profile some of these “absentee” players on the RSP Blog 
in the coming months. If they get drafted or make a team, some of them will also appear in the post-draft publication.  
 
Since this publication was written prior to the NFL Draft, the rankings are a reflection of skill on the field. My analyses aren’t 
diluted or inflated by any speculation of a player’s character or draft stock. It’s about my view of their on-field talent, 
versatility, and potential. 
 
In any dynasty league setting, I would be comfortable acquiring the first 24 runners on this list during a draft or the free 
agency period when teams can have expanded preseason rosters. In leagues with roster sizes of more than 40 players and 
practice squad spots, I’d consider an additional 6-8 of these runners.  
 
This class has little separation in grade among the 13 players in the second tier. Any of the first 14 backs on the board could 
emerge as a productive rookie contributor with the right opportunity, team fit, and quick acclimation to at least 1-2 facets of 
their games that need immediate improvement.  
 
There are 13 backs with at least a score of 80 which is one more than last year’s group that was more heralded because of 
a few more players at the top of the board with strong grades. This class has a bad rep despite the fact that there are more 
players within range to contribute than last year. As we know, not many backs make immediate contributions as starters so 
the prevailing narrative that this class is bad will rule until proven otherwise.  
 
Considering that there are a lot of veteran talents still going strong from the 2017-2023 classes, the 2024 class is entering a 
league with a massive talent glut, but with a lot of unpredictable turnover. It’s another year where patience will be required 
for mid-to-late picks at running back. 
 
The top back has All-Pro potential. The next eight have Pro-Bowl potential with an ideal fit. The five after that could develop 
into contributors with meaningful fantasy production.  
 
In total, there are 12 runners in this class worth re-draft consideration and 25 worthwhile for shallow dynasty formats. 
There are 25-30 I’d take in the average dynasty format. And there are 35 I’ll be watching over the next 2-3 seasons. 
 
Again, running back has a tremendous amount of turnover due to injury and intense competition. Teams aren’t as tolerant 
of mistakes from mid-round, late-round, and undrafted runners, and the market value for productive backs with more than 
3-4 years of experience often gets played against the latest crop of younger players who have less wear and tear.  
 
My recommendation for the position in 2024: This draft class overall is regarded as a bad because there are not 
enough no-brainer immediate starters at the top. Even if this class is stronger than people think, few classes field more than 
three starters with multiple productive seasons. Most field 1-2, so it’s wiser to stockpile receivers and/or quarterbacks in the 
first 2-3 rounds. 
 
Because the demand for feature backs is lower, gap schemes are back in vogue, and the pool of viable talent is broader, 
backs continue to have a greater boom-bust value.  
 
 
 
 
A Dose of Perspective  
 
First-time readers of the Rookie Scouting Portfolio will probably find some of these rankings surprising. It’s not intentional. I 
have my own process and because I grew my business from obscurity, I didn’t have the pressure to perform to certain 
expectations and pressures that accompany a corporate media stage. 
 
While I didn’t have the advantage of an instant audience, the upside of building this publication’s audience organically is 
that I could stay true to my process rather than pay attention to the crowd. I often don’t find out how different the results 
of my analysis are until after I publish.  
 
I’ve had (and will continue to have) my share of misses, but after a decade of liking players like Nick Chubb, Ray Rice, Matt 
Forte, Joseph Addai, Ahmad Bradshaw, Isiah Pacheco, Khalil Herbert, Rhamondre Stevenson, Jonathan Taylor, Spencer 
Ware, Le’Veon Bell, and several others more than the crowd, I’ve learned to accept the variances—even if it’s never a 
completely comfortable feeling.

Few people have a definable process in this industry. If I abandon staying true to my process and alter my outcomes based 
on what others say, I’ll never make it better. And based solely on the growth of this publication, the process has improved.  
 
I’ve written this as a preface to what you’re about to read below. The views at the top of this positional ranking will surely 
differ from the norm—a difference that I had little chance of missing this year. It’s a development that reminds me of the 
top of the 2007 running back class.  
 
That group’s marquee runner, Adrian Peterson, was a generational talent. It was easy to see that he could someday be 
mentioned in the same sentence as the likes of Earl Campbell, Walter Payton, Barry Sanders, and LaDainian Tomlinson. In 
the 13 years I’ve been studying players for this publication, I have never been more excited about a player’s talent than his.  
 
At the same time, this buzzsaw of a back had flaws that legitimately could have slowed his transition to the NFL. He carried 
the ball low and wide of his body—he had 20 fumbles during his first 3 seasons (imagine Tom Coughlin as his coach)—and 
he lacked the patience to let certain plays develop, which led to feast-or-famine outputs on those runs and put more stress 
on the offense to overcome poor down-and-distance situations.  
 
None of these issues killed Peterson’s value, but they were legitimate concerns that he struggled with even as he ran 
roughshod over the league behind a good offensive line that helped Chester Taylor earn 1,300 yards the year before 
Peterson’s arrival. Imagine Peterson behind a line like the 2016 Los Angeles Rams and there might have been media 
analysis questioning if Peterson was really that talented.  
 
In that same class was a back who wasn’t matching the headlines of Peterson at Oklahoma, and I didn’t think he was a 
slam dunk to become a generational talent. However, when I evaluated Marshawn Lynch at Cal, I saw the balance, refined 
vision, receiving ability, dynamic cutting, and skill to work through multiple levels of contact and maintain the same rate of 
speed. Lynch wasn’t a breakaway threat like Peterson—he moved with the speed and density of a tank. However, he had 
the agility of a street bike.  
 
When my evaluations were completed, I found that my grading loved Peterson. However, it liked Lynch just a little bit more. 
Ask 100 football fans from around the world who they thought was a better back and I’d bet a majority would say Peterson 
in his prime. I wouldn’t argue with them.  
 
However, ask those fans if they thought Lynch was a notable downgrade and I’d bet a majority would say absolutely not. 
Peterson has earned 14,291 yards from scrimmage, 104 touchdowns, and 42 fumbles during his career. Lynch has earned 
12,133 yards from scrimmage, 90 touchdowns, and 28 fumbles.  
 
Lynch is also the No. 8 rusher all-time in the playoffs, and none of the seven backs ahead of him played in a pass-happy 
era. Beast Mode also authored one of the most difficult and clutch runs in the history of the game during the playoffs.  
 
Peterson was the back most would prefer to have during any given year in a fantasy league. More people than you think 
would prefer Lynch on their NFL team of choice.  
 
As a publication that caters to fantasy football owners and real football people (media, scouts, and consultants), I consider 
both settings. Ultimately, I care more about reality when the margin between players is close.  
 
Four years ago, I liked Nick Chubb just a little bit more than Saquon Barkley. I recognized Barkley’s awesome talent but 
believed Chubb would be a little more consistent on a carry-to-carry basis. This turned out to be true when Chubb earned 
the starting role midseason, despite the fact that Barkley dominated in sheer production volume.  
 
Keep in mind that the Cleveland Browns signed Duke Johnson to a contract extension and added Carlos Hyde in free agency 
prior to selecting Chubb in the second round. While I subsequently told readers that Chubb’s draft capital was too high for 
him to be stuck long-term behind Hyde, many found this difficult to believe.  
 
Further, I explained that Hyde and Johnson would be expendable sooner than it appeared. The Browns traded Hyde to 
Jacksonville at midseason and Johnson found his way to the Texans. Although Kareem Hunt clouded the picture some for 
Chubb, it didn’t stop Chubb from nearly capturing the league rushing title two years ago and he was a top-12 producer 
when healthy last year.  
 
Fans and analysts have come around to the fact that Chubb is an elite running back. As they say on Twitter, he’s not the 
only player where I have a meaningful receipt. It’s not some attention-seeking ploy. I usually don’t know how much my 
thoughts differ from convention until I’m writing up the players in March.  
 
Since I began this publication 17 years ago, I’ve had to embrace risk. This includes having a unique method for studying 
players that arrives at conclusions that sometimes go against the group-think of draftniks. It will always be that way.

RB Jonathan Brooks RSP Scouting Profile 
 
RSP Ranking: RB1 
Jersey: No.24

The Elevator Pitch: Brooks is rehabbing an ACL tear that he suffered in November. Worst case, Brooks won’t be back to 
his physical prime until a year from publication. Given the injury, one season as a starter after succeeding Bijan Robinson, 
and the state of the running back position in the NFL, the injury could drop Brooks somewhere between rounds 3-5.  
Don’t let that dissuade you from appropriately valuing Books’ ability and potential. He is the best back in this class and if his 
ACL injury does not lead to future issues with staying healthy or impact his pre-injury athletic skills, Brooks would have 
been the RSP’s second-ranked back in last year’s class—just above the excellent Jahmyr Gibbs.  
Brooks moves like a veteran in the prime of his NFL career. He’s the most efficient mover of this year’s running back who is 
capable of both dynamic and subtle moves to set up blockers, elude defenders in traffic or in space, and deliver or deflect 
punishment.  
Brooks doesn’t look 216 pounds, but he uses every ounce of it to run through contact—often multiple points of contact 
during a carry. This includes multiple reaches and multiple hits. Most running backs don’t pull through good wraps with 
great frequency based on the RSP’s past few years of tracking tackle types.  
Brooks is no exception, but he can pull through combinations of reaches, wraps, and hits on the same play and the heavy 
contact coming from linebackers and safeties. That’s the sign of a good NFL starter because most run designs set up where 
the offensive line accounts for the defensive linemen—at least enough that the runner should have the space to avoid or pull 
through a reach. 
If a runner is winning collisions with safeties that’s expected. If the runner is defeating linebacker hits and wraps in the 
hole, that’s not what the offensive line coach optimally wants to see with a lot of designs but is happy he has a quality back 
who does it.   
Brooks has this skill in abundance, and he understands that initiating this contact is better than taking the contact from a 
defender initiating it. The hitter takes less punishment when delivering with sound technique. The hitter, being the initiator 
of the action, gets the first opportunity to make a second move as the person getting hit is still reacting to the first move.  
Longhorns’ alum, Jamaal Charles was about 20 pounds lighter than Brooks, and this was his approach to running the 
football. Much like Charles, Brooks runs like the game has already slowed down for him. We’ll see if his time rehabbing a 
serious injury forces more acclimation time on and NFL field that might have been accelerated if he arrived in the league 
healthy.  
In addition to contact balance, power, and decision-making, Brooks has the acceleration and speed to flip the field. He’s not 
a twitched-up breakaway runner, runner but he has the speed to generate big plays on a regular basis from anywhere on 
the field because he accelerates smoothly and effortlessly, and he can maintain his top speed over a distance. Because 
Brooks sees the field well and has smooth movement, he doesn’t lose a lot of speed changing direction. 
Brooks’s route game won’t remind you of Austin Ekeler at this stage of his career, but he’s an effective receiver from the 
backfield who should become a reliable component of screens, swing passes, and wide routes who could deliver more if 
called upon. Brooks catches the ball effortlessly and has strong hand-eye coordination.  
In addition to his skills as a runner and receiver, Brooks is the best pass protector at the position in this class. He has a 
technically-sound punch, he diagnoses pressure with good detail, and he’s equally good in the pocket and in open space.

Brooks is worth a team’s wait if they give him a red-shirt season to rehab his injury. The oft-repeated sentiment about his 
running back class is that it’s not a good one. It may not be as strong at the top when comparing the number of prospects 
with starter grades as recent classes, but Brooks would have been the No.2 or No.3 runner on any of the RSP’s RB boards 
since 2020.  
What is the best scheme fit? Brooks’ ability to create makes him a good zone runner, especially inside zone, but he has 
the athletic ability to produce in outside zone. He’s also rugged enough and smooth enough of an accelerator to produce in 
a gap scheme. The Ravens would be an ideal fit because they have Derrick Henry as the lead back and can afford to wait a 
year on Brooks. The Cowboys could be another, but they will probably be in love with a back like Trey Benson. Just a hunch, 
but Benson seems more Jerry Jones’s type.  
What is his ceiling scenario? Brooks isn’t as fast as Cadillac Williams was at Auburn, but his combination of smooth 
running in traffic and physicality is a good stylistic comparison. Another is a savvier and more athletic Melvin Gordon. Either 
way, that type of ability indicates top-10 statistical production as a starter as Brooks’ potential peak.  
What is his floor scenario? Brooks fails to return fully from his ACL tear and has career as a reserve or mid-level 
contributor to a committee.  
Physical: Brooks doles out punishment with excellent pad level, impressive bend at the knees and waist, and leads with the 
forearm away from his frame when possible. At this point, Brooks is a player who can run around you, through you, or carry 
you.   
Technical: Brooks’s punch against defenders his size and larger as a pass protector from the pocket is impressive.  
Conceptual: Brooks sees the field with the maturity of a veteran and makes wise decisions as a runner. He understands 
how to set up blocks and makes runs look easier than they are.  
Intuitive: Brooks has a feel for how to combine movements as a runner. He doesn’t just lean on 1-2 moves that become 
predictable. As a result, Brooks makes multiple defenders miss in tight space.  
Build: A long-legged back who may sometimes look like he’s 200-205 pounds, but he‘s a legitimate 216-pound runner with 
every-down potential.  
Vision: Brooks identifies interior penetration. He’ll press toward it to set up the crease away from the penetrator’s leverage. 
If there are two points of penetration as he takes the exchange and no exit, he drops the pads, gets under the shots, and 
takes what’s available.  
He’s a capable zone and gap runner who sets up double teams or pullers pulls with a quick look to one side and then stays 
tight to his lead blocker to maximize space between himself and the backside pursuit.  
He sets up double teams on inside zone and can come to a quick stop to allow the pursuit to pass and get downhill. Brooks 
presses creases between the tackles within one step of his blockers.  
Elusiveness: Brooks can alter his stride length to set up blockers. He also gets his knees and feet high to work over fallen 
blockers. He can also get over or work through hard shots to his legs because of his balance and footwork. He can point the 
toe and open his hips to execute 90-degree turns.  
Brooks makes moves in succession that can elude multiple defenders in a tight space and then get downhill with maybe one 
transition step.  
He has tight and fluid turns downhill as a runner in tight space and a receiver near the boundary in the open field. He makes 
the first man miss so often that I’d bet on him doing so more than any back in this class. He often makes the first two 
defenders miss.  
Brooks adjusts pace and stride length to set up defenders and blockers. He extends well for the marker or pylon, timing it 
effectively and fully extending for the target.  
Acceleration: Brooks has enough acceleration to beat a safety with an angle at the far hash to the boundary as well as up 
the near side boundary.  
Speed: Brooks can pull away from safeties in the open field.  


Text from page 249:

Power: Brooks has good reach and position with his stiff arm on perimeter runs. He can ward off a linebacker in the flat 
with his reach. He runs through reaches from all three levels of defenders and wraps from linebackers and defensive backs.  
Brooks has effective pad level and keeps his feet moving. This helps him run through wraps from cornerbacks and continue 
moving downfield when safeties wrap him high. He can also drop his weight and keep his feet moving when under the pads 
of defenders.  
Brooks can run through multiple reaches and combinations of hits, wraps, and reaches. He repeatedly has run through 
multiple hits. He delivers the first contact and braces himself well for oncoming contact with his pad level and free arm.  
Direct Contact Balance: Brooks can stalemate a direct collision with a linebacker in the hole where both parties are 
coming downhill into the collision point. When he gets his pads low enough, he can win the collisions with linebackers.  
Indirect Contact Balance: Brooks wins collisions with middle linebackers on off-tackle runs at the entrance of the hole 
and off-ball linebackers at the end of the crease. He knows how to deliver a hit so he’s not hitting a defender square. He can 
bounce off multiple hits from linebackers during the same run.  
Routes: Brooks has flat drive and line steps. He’s aware of the boundary and can get both feet inbounds when there’s room 
for him to maintain a larger stride.  
Receiving: Brooks tracks the ball over his shoulder and uses overhand attack to earn the ball at its earliest point. He can 
also extend one hand far from his frame and make a leaning catch over his shoulder while running away from the target.  
Blocking: Before releasing from the line of scrimmage, Brooks will drop a pad into the shoulder of an edge defender. When 
the backside blocker of the edge containment, he’ll get his hands tight to the chest for the opponent, deliver an uppercut 
and roll through the hips. His hands are tight and he earns a tight position to the chest of the defender—even defensive 
ends. He runs his feet after the initial strike to stay with the opponent’s redirect.  
Brooks identifies T-E twists and squares the inside looper. He’s assertive about taking his half of a double team with a tackle 
to prevent the edge defender from even gaining the corner.  
Brooks is also deliberate as an interior protector, waiting to release until he has ensured that he’s not allow a green dawg 
pressure from one of two linebackers with potential to blitz through an interior gap. Brooks also identifies and foils slot 
blitzes working inside the tackle.  
Brooks is also a patient and effective stalk blocker who earns tight position to his assignment, gets his hands inside, and 
keeps his feet moving to turn the opponent away from the path to the ballcarrier.  
Ball Security: Brooks carries the ball close to his chest and under his boundary-side arm.  He has 2 fumbles in 266 
touches, 1 per 133. He only had 1 fumble in 212 touches in 2023. He can take multiple swats onto the ball from behind 
during a run and he maintains possession. 
Durability: ACL tear vs TCU in November 2023. Hernia surgery in March 2023.  
 
Pre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: With the wealth of quarterbacks and receivers as well as Brock Bowers, running backs 
could easily fall to the second and third rounds in fantasy drafts this year. Brooks could also find himself RB3-RB5 in some 
formats because of his ACL tear—at least before the NFL determines his draft capital. If you’re drafting before the NFL, you 
could be in luck to capitalize on this potential good fortune if you’re willing to take a second-round or early third-round pick 
who might not be ready until 2005.

RB Blake Corum RSP Scouting Profile 
 
RSP Ranking: RB2  
Jersey: No. 2 
Height/Weight: 5-8/205 School: Michigan  
Comparison Spectrum: Ray Rice – X – Devin Singletary/Kyren Williams 
 
Depth of Talent Score: 83.5 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths.

The Elevator Pitch: When factoring injuries, skill, versatility, and athletic ability, Corum is arguably the safest running 
back in this class. It doesn’t mean he’s the best bet to become a starter of value. Corum’s range of outcomes has a wide 
range for a second-ranked runner.  
Corum is small enough that, if his processing and explosion don’t translate as well as projected, he could be a more 
functionally-sound and productive version of Mike Hart. For those of you who don’t remember Hart, the former Michigan 
starter was third-string back for the Colts during his short stint in the NFL. While possible Corum begins his career as a 
third-string option, it’s unlikely that’s where he will end because even the low-end outcome of his explosion is probably as a 
second back in a rotation.  
If Corum’s skills translate as expected and he can add another 5-10 pounds of muscle, he has the skills to at least earn a 
close to 50/50 split in a backfield if not take the lead role. He runs with excellent decision-making, he’s efficient with his 
movements, and he’s also capable of quick-twitch dynamic footwork. Because he runs with strong pad level, contact-
aggression, and balance for his size, even a moderate addition of muscle could help him ascend a depth chart into a 
significant role.  
If Corum’s skills translate as expected and he adds 10-15 pounds of muscle and either builds on his explosion and 
mobility—or at least doesn’t sacrifice any of what he has shown at Michigan—he could have a similar outcome that we saw 
from Ray Rice. For those of you who were too young to know about Rice beyond his domestic violence incident that ended 
his career, Rice entered the NFL as a 205-pound runner who carried the load at Rutgers. By his second year with the 
Ravens, Rice was 220-pounds and more explosive than he was as a rookie. Rice became an elite NFL runner.  
Corum has the vision between the tackles and in the open field coupled with toolbox of footwork and upper-body moves to 
follow suit if he proves he can add the muscle to his frame that will help him become a lead back in the league. With a torn 
meniscus in 2022, it’s worth doubting Corum can add 15 pounds and remain productive long-term.  
The area where Corum has the most to learn is pass protection. He’s an aggressive blocker who must dial back his attacks 
so he has more control with his interactions. Even so, he doesn’t have much to improve upon to become competent.  
As you can see, if the range of outcome in this assessment for Corum is accurate, he has one of the highest floors of the 
backs with talent that could develop further. That said, he’s also one of the smallest and slowest.  
Where is the player inconsistent? Corum can be prone to overextending and dropping his head into contact. Against 
edge rushers, Corum’s behavior can make his helmet and pads a low-speed bump on the way to the quarterback.  
What is the best scheme fit? He’s a versatile runner between the tackles who can work gap and outside zone and he’s 
fast enough to satisfy all but the pickiest of head coaches who demand runners with star-caliber speed and are willing to 
sacrifice ball-carrying smarts for some robotic behavior. 
What is his ceiling scenario? A career that has fans remembering Ray Rice’s peak work.  
What is his floor scenario? A career as a second back in a rotation where he gets the small end of the workload.  
Physical: Corum understands that initiating contact allows him to dictate terms with his quickness and it least to productive 
reps.   


Text from page 251:
 
63 
Technical: Corum has excellent hip flip in tight space, which allows him to change direction efficiently and be explosive.  
Conceptual: Corum’s confidence as a tight-crease runner on zone plays makes him a strong candidate to contribute 
immediately.   
Intuitive: He’s a creative open-field runner. Combined with his range of efficient and dynamic movement, Corum generates 
bigger plays than his good, but not great long speed may lead people to expect.  
Build: Short and small, but if Devin Singletary had the athletic skills of a starter he’d probably look like Corum. 
Vision: Corum reads penetration into to the backfield and finds the open lane to avoid losses. He reads leverage effectively 
and he’ll set up zone and gap blocking with his approach to the line of scrimmage. He is confident with accessing tight 
creases.  
He’s a confident tight-crease runner when running zone. He’ll press within two steps of the defense, pressing their leverage 
advantage and cutting back to his leverage advantage. He attacks these openings at full speed and with confidence.  
He’s adept at gap, Duo, and zone blocking. He’s patient on inside and outside runs and creative in the open field.  
Elusiveness: Corum can transition downhill from a boundary approach with two quick steps at full speed. He sets up blocks 
with a chance of his pacing and/or stride length as he approaches the box. He has the curvilinear speed to transition 
downhill with a slight cutback from an outside approach.  
When attacking tight creases, Corum will get his feet and knees high enough to avoid tripping over the feet of his own 
blockers. His pressure cuts are quick. His stutter step is quick enough to freeze a linebacker with an angle playing over the 
top.  
He’ll spin off contact that he initiates against edge defenders. He can combine moves such as a stick and spin, or a pressure 
cut and a jump-cut. The same is true with a jump-stop and a pressure cut.  
Corum has a quick little stutter at the edge to freeze the pursuit of a defensive end before continuing around the corner. He 
can layer a dip and a stutter together to freeze a defensive back in the open field and then hurdle over his low shot that has 
become telegraphed from the previous moves.  
Corum only needs two mini steps to transition from a perimeter path to a downhill path. He even pivots hips and legs 
downhill efficiently as if it’s part of the two quick steps.  
In addition to adjusting his stride length, Corum also adjusts his pace to set up blocks and time the opening of creases. One 
of the borderline special qualities about his agility and elusiveness is how efficiently he can flip his hips and accelerate from 
it. He can pull through a reach in the hole, flip his hips and his acceleration is sudden.  
Acceleration: Corum has notable acceleration that gets him through the line of scrimmage and into the second level when 
working between the tackles. He’s quick enough to bounce outside edge penetration from a defensive tackle.  With 10 in the 
box, Corum can take the far-side corner past linebackers in pursuit. His acceleration is good enough to prevent corners in 
the box from having a remote chance of catching him for at least 40 yards.  
Speed: Corum can sustain speed that pulls away from linebackers up the far sideline. The single high safety is the single 
option with 10 in the box to run Corum down and not until he gains 45-55 yards. The same is true with corners on the same 
side of the field who are even with Corum when they begin chasing him up the sideline and they need him to change 
direction in the open field to catch up or he pulls away.  
Power: Corum has the strength to keep his feet moving through high wraps from defensive linemen at the line of 
scrimmage and at least generate a forward lean. He attacks with his pads low enough to meet the contact of box defenders 
and continue forward.  
Corum initiates contact at the entrance of a crease. His stiff-arm is good enough to break the tackle of a safety in the 
crease. He’ll at least ward off reaches and force defenders to slide down Corum’s frame and wrap low.  
Corum’s quickness and combativeness helps him work through multiple reaches and or hits during a run. Corum can pull 
through the wrap of an off-ball linebacker in the red zone near the goal line.  


Text from page 252:
 
64 
Direct Contact Balance: Corum can win direct contact with a safety. He can also stalemate or win a direct hit with a 
linebacker at the end of an interior crease in the box. After winning a collision with a flat-footed linebacker at the end of a 
crease, Corum will spin off the contact for additional yardage.   
Indirect Contact Balance: Corum will drop the pads into a collision with a linebacker and win the interaction.  
Routes: Corum scans the field for the second-level defender when running routes against zone coverage. He works to 
depth and settles under the dropping defender.  
Receiving: Corum can attack overhand at the back shoulder on a wide route and snatch the ball to his frame. He can 
extend behind his break path and away from his frame for an overhand catch with his feet off the ground and earn the ball 
after taking a hit to his back.  
When wide open, Corum can slip into bad habits with his attack on short targets, clapping the ball near chest level with 
underhand attack. Eliminate the clapping and he’ll reduce the potential for careless error.  
Blocking: Corum delivers chips that are hard enough to slow the rush of a defender. He’s a skilled cut blocker on interior-
gap and edge blitzes against linebackers. He earns depth, squares the target, shoots across the body of the defender, and 
keeps his head up as he shoots with height and depth.  
As a stand-up blocker, he’ll work inside-out and slide across the backs of teammates with good footwork to shuffle into a 
square position against his opponent. His hands remain tight, and his elbows are bent.   
He can be prone to overextending and dropping his head into contact. Against edge rushers, Corum’s behavior can make his 
helmet and pads a low-speed bump on the way to the quarterback.  
As a pass receiver downfield, Corum knows how to run off the defender and then tilt into him to earn position and wall off 
the opponent from the ballcarrier behind him.  
Ball Security: Corum uses a high carriage and the correct arm away from pursuit. He can take contact to the ball.  
Durability: Torn meniscus in 2022. 
 
Pre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Corum won’t be as appealing to fantasy GMs as speedsters Trey Benson and Jaylen 
Wright and there will be some corners of the fantasy spectrum who will have a special brand of love for Braelon Allen. Don’t 
be surprised if Corum is available in the second half of the second-round if not later—at least prior to the NFL Draft. There’s 
such a small gap between the No.2 and 12 back in this year’s draft (and really the 13th back if you believe in Marshawn 
Lloyd’s ability to improve his ball security), ADP will have a lot of variance at RB.

The Elevator Pitch: Benson is the runner in this big second tier who appears to be making improvements to his game at 
the right time and might have the perception that he has the most potential to become a productive NFL starter. He’s 
already big and fast enough and he has become a more decisive player between the tackles.  
Benson’s skill with gap blocking and outside zone also makes him an appealing fit for a number of NFL teams that run the 
Shanahan/McVay offenses that seek speed and aggression as the tiebreaker for prospects ahead of creativity and patience. 
Not that these offenses don’t want patient backs, but it’s not as high of a priority for these offenses as you might find with 
schemes that run more inside zone.  
If Benson can improve his pre-snap reads of boxes and make strong game management decisions with where to attack, he 
has all of the physical tools to become a team’s lead back. Even without reading box counts against potential blitzes, he’s 
appropriately conservative about avoiding risk-taking when his offense is backed up deep in its own end of the field or the 
red zone.  
He’s a powerful runner but when he spots an unblocked linebacker at the other side of a crease, Benson doesn’t attack as 
aggressively as he should. Rashaad White and Travis Etienne had this issue entering the league, but both have become 
more aggressive and it has benefited their games.  
Unlike White and Etienne, Benson has work ahead to become an effective route runner beyond screens, wide routes, and 
swing passes. He tracks the ball well, but has bouts of poor attack technique that he must address so he lowers the risk of 
dropping balls he shouldn’t.  
Benson’s pass protection is at least a year away from him becoming competent. Given the promise of his game, Benson 
could start as a rookie but like White, he may not look nearly as promising Year One as he did at FSU. Ideally, Benson and 
his new team would benefit most from giving the rookie a smaller role and give him a year to work at his deficiencies during 
the offseason.  
If Benson improves faster than projected, gets a year, and improves as hoped, or earns a role that minimizes his 
weaknesses, he could deliver value immediately. Three “ifs,” means don’t rule it out but don’t count on it.  
Where has the player improved? He’s more aggressive with hitting creases and his pad level to attack downhill in 2023.  
Where is the player inconsistent? Catching the football. He has impressive highs and equally unimpressive lows. 
What is the best scheme fit? Duo and gap schemes. He could become much better at Duo if he reads the line of 
scrimmage pre-snap and learns to make decisions based on it.  
What is his ceiling scenario? What those bullish about Marlon Mack at USF expected because he’s a more accomplished 
decision-maker.   
What is his floor scenario? A one-dimensional back who doesn’t improve his passing-down skills and winds up a talented 
reserve who can’t hang onto a starting gig because of these deficiencies.  


Text from page 254:
 
66 
Physical: Benson can run through defenders as well as carry them. He must recognize opportunities when he must be that 
guy.   
Technical: Benson doesn’t earn position early enough to deliver effective strikes as a blocker. If he can figure out how to 
address this problem, he fixes the weakest and most fundamental link with his blocking and the rest of his pass protection 
could blossom quicker than expected.  
Conceptual: Benson alters his stride length and pacing effectively as an inside runner.  
Intuitive: He lacks feel for how to use his footwork and movement as a route runner. It’s not enough ingrained into his 
game to combine movements the way he does as an open-field runner. He must get there.  
Build: Average size for a lead back.  
Vision: Benson is comfortable running off-tackle zone and Counter. When running Counter, he will work off his backside 
puller and the veer toward the perimeter block to scrape inside that blocker so he’s making room away from the inside 
pursuit.  
With inside zone, Benson is patient enough to press outside the lane to move a linebacker and then make the cutback to the 
inside. Benson reads leverage and position with first- and second-level defenders.  
He could up his game to the next level if he begins making accurate pre-snap reads of box counts and choosing a cutback or 
bounce path to set up that has fewer defenders. He misses these opportunities right now and leaves yardage on the field.  
I want to see more aggression to attack unblocked defenders in the crease when he determines his lane. He’s decisive 
about where to go but not about how to attack it at full speed. It was better in the 2023 opener against LSU.  
Benson has efficient footwork against interior or edge penetration, and this helps him turn losses into gains.  He’s wise 
about not bouncing or cutting plays back, especially in the red zone. He manages the game well for a rookie.  
Benson can press within a step of his blockers—in gap or zone scenarios and force linebackers out of position.  
Elusiveness: Benson has enough curvilinear bend and speed to work away from edge and interior penetrators during a 
perimeter approach and get downhill of them. He opens his hips well to avoid penetration into the backfield and can use this 
to either bounce a play or cutback to the inside from edge penetration. Benson can also jump-stop into the hip opener. 
He’ll spin through reaches to his upper body. In the open field, Benson will use a three-step juke combination to set up a 
defender into a lead block or bait the defender to the wrong crease. He can change the stride length to set up the juke.  
At the edge or just outside the tackle box Benson only needs two quick steps to transition from a perimeter approach to a 
downhill lane. He has some instances of slipping on turf that he must improve.  
Benson has good stride alteration to stay behind his pullers on gap plays. He alters his pacing effectively as well.  
When he cuts downhill, he gets his hips square early in the transition.  
Acceleration: Benson has the acceleration to beat box defenders and some safeties to the far-side flat on a perimeter run 
and turn the corner on them. If he earns an angle on a cornerback on the same side of the field, Benson can maintain 
separation.  
His top gear is good enough to pull away from many safeties. His initial acceleration is good enough to get past linebackers 
and cornerbacks within a few yards of him when he gets downhill.  
Speed: Benson can extend runs past linebackers and force defensive backs to chase him down. If he doesn’t have to set up 
blocks against defenders over the top and slow down to put moves on opponents, he appears as if he can outrun defensive 
backs—at least safeties and cornerbacks aligned to the opposite side of the field to begin the play.  
Power: Benson can pull through multiple reaches from defensive linemen. He keeps his feet moving when wrapped high. 
During the course of a run, Benson can run through two reaches and bounce off a hit to his side.  


Text from page 255:
 
67 
His stiff-arm is strong enough to ward off the reach of a defensive end diving for his frame from backside pursuit. He has 
enough reach with the stiff-arm to ward off a safety with a well-placed extension to the opponent’s chest while in the open 
field and running at top speed.  
Benson drops his pads into oncoming defenders and attacks first, but he can be more aggressive with this pacing. He has 
shown improvement with this during the two games I watched in 2023.   
Direct Contact Balance: Because he’s not as aggressive with hitting open creases that he knows a linebacker or safety will 
fill, he is susceptible to losing collisions that he could at least stalemate, if not win if he accelerated into the contact. Benson 
can bounce off the contact head-on of a linebacker when he has the downhill momentum into the second level and the 
linebacker does not.  
Indirect Contact Balance: He has a good balance-touch through contact to his feet when in the open field. He bounces off 
glancing shots from safeties to his side and back. He bounces off indirect shots from linebackers and incidental contact in 
the hole from defensive linemen.  
Routes: When facing a linebacker one-on-one and executing a 90-degree break, Benson doesn’t execute a flat enough 
break to prevent the trailing linebacker from undercutting the target.  
In one-on-one situations, Benson’s movements illustrate that he can be quick and agile, but he has zero plan of attack or 
technique to set up defenders. He looks like a backyard amateur trying to run routes against man-to-man coverage.  
Benson identifies the second-level defender in zone coverage, works to depth, and settles into the open area. When he 
doesn’t receive a target, he works to the open area. When the QB breaks the pocket, he tilts into the defender to wall off 
the opponent for his ballcarrier.  
Receiving: Benson will change his hands position with his attack of targets at the last second. He’ll begin with overhand 
and his arms away from his body and quickly change to underhand closer to his frame. The underhand position also brings 
his hands wider from each other than they were in overhand position because of the last-second change.  
This behavior also leads to clapping the target from either side. The last second change from overhand to underhand 
exacerbates the tendency to clap onto the ball. It limits his potential to earn a clean catch against tight coverage making 
contact.  
When Benson doesn’t change his position at the last second, he will attack the ball away from his frame with tight overhand 
position.  
Benson can win back-shoulder routes at the boundary in the shallow range of the field against tight coverage. He times his 
jump back and through effectively. He could extend his arms and attack the ball with overhand position, but he has caught 
the ball with underhand attack and executed a good pull down while keeping his feet inbounds.  
Benson tracks the ball over his shoulder effectively.  
Blocking: Benson will diagnose inside-out but when he finishes accounting for the inside, he can misread the leverage of 
the edge pressure on the tackle and fail to slide over to help. When edge protection fails in an obvious way because Benson 
is encountering a defender he shouldn’t, Benson must make the connection so he can block rather than allow the opponent 
through untouched.  
Benson will use an uppercut when he attacks a defender. He must earn a square position before he delivers it. He also gets 
beaten to the punch and too often plays patty-cake rather than strikes. This allows safeties to push him into the 
quarterback’s lap despite earning depth into the line when setting up.  
He’s helpful with chipping edge defenders. He doesn’t overdo his strikes and that keeps his tackle in favorable position.  
He misses angles as a lead blocker on perimeter runs. When he takes a good angle, he moves his feet effectively and gets 
his hands into the chest of the opponent.  
Overall, FSU used him as a check-down or screen receiver or wheel option up the boundary. They send him into routes 
more often than use him as a blocker. He’s more of a patty-cake blocker at this point and must address this dimension of 
his game to optimize his growth as a pro.

Ball Security: Benson carries the ball high to his chest, but his elbow is loose from his frame. He can take swats to the ball 
and his ballcarrying arm.  
Durability: Missed his 2020 season in Oregon with tears to his ACL, PCL, MCL, medial and lateral meniscus, and hamstring. 
It was a non-contact injury while cutting away from a defender during practice as part of the scout team.  
 
Pre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: If you think Benson is the top back in this class that is healthy, I won’t argue with you. 
He’s the best combination of strength, speed, and quickness and has already shown improvement as a decision-maker. 
What he needs to address is fixable, too. Whether he does depends on his work ethic, self-awareness, and ability to 
maintain his confidence in tough environments. He’s probably the back most likely to have a stable ADP among the top 
three at this position in most drafts. That probably translates to a second-round value and that’s fair.

RB Jaylen Wright RSP Scouting Profile 
 
RSP Ranking: RB4 
Jersey: No.20 
Height/Weight: 5-10/210 School: Tennessee  
Comparison Spectrum: Alvin Kamara – Raheem Mostert - X/Tony Pollard – Justin Jackson  
 
Depth of Talent Score: 83.4 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. 
 
Games Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): 
• 
Clemson ‘22 
• 
Georgia ‘22 
• 
Florida ‘23 
• 
Alabama ‘23 
• 
Georgia ‘23 
 
The Elevator Pitch: The RSP uses Breadth of Talent Scores as a tiebreaker for the Depth of Talent grade used for 
rankings. The logic behind the tiebreaker is that the RSP’s audience is a wide range of people: NFL executives, scouts, 
football media, and fantasy GMs. It means the two players perform equally well with “how well” they execute (Depth of 
Talent) then the tiebreaker for this wide range of people should be “how much” they can potentially do on the field (Breadth 
of Talent). 
Trey Benson and Jaylen Wright are tied for RB3 in Depth of Talent and that’s how I see it. However, for the sake of 
differentiating them, Benson offers a little more to the most teams at this point.  
Another important note about this topic: Because there’s less than a point separating seven backs on this list, I have zero 
argument about their actual order if there’s a logical criterion for what’s expected for the runners based on the scheme, 
system, and wants of an organization/audience.  
Wright could easily develop into the best back in this class. This is not what I would have thought six months ago, but, if it 
matters beyond a small amount of entertainment value, Wright’s game and potential grew on me as I saw more of his film.  
Backs usually earn lower scores and additional doubt about their potential when they are prone to bouncing plays outside 
when there are logical play designs unfolding inside based on available leverage advantages that their blockers create. 
Wright’s speed and decisive nature compensates enough at this level that he can ignore leverage and bounce runs for 
chain-moving gains and breakaway runs.  
Wright won’t dominate on speed and acceleration alone in the NFL. It means he’ll have to crease the tight but well-blocked 
interior gaps can get him past linebackers and into the secondary untouched if he wants to be as good in the pros as he was 
in college.   
Despite what Wright still has to learn, he demonstrates skill between the tackles with setting up lead blockers and moving 
middle linebackers into blocks that less disciplined runners of his archetype have had trouble doing. This history gives 
Wright more saving grace to his game than what Tevin Coleman demonstrated at Indiana and throughout his career.  
Wright’s movement is one of the most appealing facets of his game. He has strong stop-start skill, efficient hip mobility, and 
a range of footwork applications that set up creases and make defenders miss in space.  
Wright also does a great job of getting his feet and knees high enough to work through reaches and wraps. This is one of 
the most Alvin Kamara-like aspects of his game—especially the kicking of his heels to his backside to extricate his lower 
legs from wraps.  
Unlike Kamara, Wright is not an elite contact-runner. He has things to address as a pass protector and receiver but 
depending on how good of a student of the game he is, Wright could make up ground fast in either area and become a 
dependable passing game weapon.  
Wright, like Tony Pollard, has the explosive game to initially produce well—and get overhyped—in scenarios that aren’t as 
conceptually demanding as what the defense presents to the lead back in the offense. Like Pollard, Wright can eventually 
improve to the point that he can assume the mantel of a lead runner in the NFL.  
Where has the player improved? His pass protection, especially with position and punch.   


Text from page 258:
 
70 
Where is the player inconsistent? Sticking runs inside when the leverage dictates but the crease is tight.  
What is the best scheme fit? Initially, the Tony Pollard-D’Andre Swift role of screens, tosses, draws, and Counter plays 
that give Wright easy decisions and get him into space quickly. 
What is his ceiling scenario? Lead runner and every-down back.  
What is his floor scenario? Space player in a committee with limited value between the tackles.  
Physical: Speed, acceleration, and short-area quickness are strengths.   
Technical: The ability to slip lower-leg wraps is a hidden strength of his game.  
Conceptual: Wright must become more disciplined about attacking tight creases. He should watch Raheem Mostert.  
Intuitive: Wright’s ability to use his movement skills and apply a variety of moves is well-ingrained into his game. 
Build: He should add another 5-7 pounds of muscle to his frame by his second season and that will get him to the average 
size of a lead back.  
Vision: Wright will press the inside gap before taking the edge on a run designed to the perimeter. He’ll spot penetration off 
the edge during the exchange and take evasive action to at least avoid an immediate tackle.  
Tennessee uses Wright on gap plays like Lead Draw, Duo, Counter, and Toss. He will set up the lead blocker with a press to 
the outside shoulder on runs where creases will open at inside gaps. He takes what’s there on these plays rather than 
attempting a high-risk decision. 
When there is penetration foiling the puller’s angle, Wright will press within a step of the puller and find the cutback lane for 
positive yards.  
He’ll run inside zone and understands how to press the middle linebacker in the crease within 1-2 steps before issuing a 
jump-cut to set up that MLB into the block. 
Elusiveness: Wright will alter his stride length and pace to set up creases. He has pressure cuts and jump-cuts that are 
effective. He can use two jump-cuts in succession to avoid a pair of defenders laterally and get downhill. Wright also jump 
stops within a step of the penetration and sidesteps the defender into another crease.  
Wright leans on stutter steps with a punch to set up presses and bounces/cutbacks to open lanes.  
Wright uses a spin after he’s wrapped to work through contact. In the open field, Wright spins away from pursuit that 
arrives as he’s catching the football.  
When encountering interior penetration after the exchange, Wright can point the toe to efficiently open his hips and follow 
up with a hard downhill cut to remain inside the outside containment. This is a good combination showing off the potential 
for layering moves in succession.  
Wright can come to a quick stop and transition downhill from a perimeter track within two short steps and on some far-side 
runs, no transition steps at all. He often needs no transition to go from a downhill track to a boundary track. He’s sudden 
and efficient with the change of direction.  
He restarts quick enough to get through the hole or get outside the linebacker he froze with the move. Wright also utilizes a 
jump stop and restart to transition from an outside track to get through an interior crease.  
Wright kicks his heels to his backside to avoid low shots from trailing defenders.  
Acceleration: Wright has the acceleration to work the near-side or far-side perimeter and turn the corner on box 
defenders. He can accelerate past safeties and near-side corners.  
Speed: Wright has the long speed to hold off box defenders when he earns an open lane into the secondary and he’ll 
extend his lead on some near-side cornerbacks and safeties.  


Text from page 259:
 
71 
Power: Wright has an effective stiff arm on perimeter runs to ward off reaches from linebackers. He’ll pull through the 
reaches of safeties who contact him above the beltline. Wright can pull through the reach of a defensive tackle in the box 
when meeting the defender downhill. Wright forces the defender to fully wrap up and hang on if the initial contact is a 
reach.  
Wright has the strength to pull box defenders downhill when wrapped high and from behind.  
Wright’s pad level isn’t naturally low as he runs, but he gets his pads lower with effective lean as he works toward contact, 
meeting the defender with a downhill alignment and capable of bouncing off the initial contact to force a wrap-up.  
Direct Contact Balance: Wright can stalemate a safety in the hole. When a defensive tackle is sliding off a block and not 
headed downhill, Wright can stalemate the tackle in a tight crease.  
Indirect Contact Balance: Wright will bounce off high indirect hits from defensive backs in the open field and stalemate a 
defensive lineman in the hole with some assistance that may not make it something worth crediting considering that 
linebackers can hit him in the side from a short distance and knock Wright sideways.  
Routes: Wright identifies the second-level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area while making a friendly 
target to the quarterback. When facing man coverage underneath, Wright has a sudden double up at the top of his stem. 
The drive step out of the turn with his break can be flatter.  
Receiving: Wright catches the ball at chest height with overhand attack. He tracks the ball over his shoulder with 
underhand attack wide of his frame while running away from the target.  
He allows targets into his numbers with underhand attack when it would benefit him to attack with overhand position.  
Wright can attack wide and low of his frame in stride and bounce off a hit to the front of his legs as he retracts the ball.  
Wright transitions with catch and pierce principles, but can eliminate the stutter or stick that appears a habit after most of 
his initial turns and just get downhill fast.  
Blocking: Wright recognizes interior pressure from linebackers. He’ll shuffle his feet with a wide base to slide across the 
guard and center to the opposite guard and earn a square position with his elbows bent, hands tight, and aiming for the 
opponent’s chest.  
Against linebackers one-on-one, he has lapses where takes contact rather than delivers it. Or, he’ll drop his head and 
overextend to deliver a shoulder rather than a punch and he’s susceptible to swim moves. When he’s on-point with his 
technique, he delivers his hands with his head up. He doesn’t roll through his hips for most of his career, but he has shown 
improvement here. He initiates the contact and can stalemate a hard collision with an inside linebacker and follow up with a 
second punch.  
When double-teaming a defensive lineman, Wright is also prone to taking contact and must develop a punch. Defenders 
larger than Wright will move him backward in one-on-one assignments because Wright must develop a balanced strike and 
initiate the contact.  
Wright can be a step or two slow to reach the linebacker looping from inside the box to the outside shoulder of the tackle. 
He reaches the spot late. Wright reads safety and corner blitzes in time to set up and deliver his hands rather than taking 
contact. He does not redirect well, even when he delivers contact. Because he has improved his punch, he has also 
improved his opportunities to redirect and his follow-ups are improving.   
Wright reads T-E twists and helps his guard inside. When helping with a defensive tackle before releasing into a route over 
the middle, Wright must discern when it’s best to stick with the block rather than release.  
Wright has good timing and trajectory across and through the frame of linebackers when he cut blocks off the edge. He 
keeps his head and eyes up to see the target. He must shoot higher on the opponent’s frame, otherwise, he gives the 
opponent a second-chance opportunity close to the quarterback.  
Ball Security: Wright carries the ball high to his frame. He uses the boundary-side arm based on the location of the play 
design but has lapses with defaulting to his right arm. Will allow the ball to be punched out with a wrap from a defensive 
tackle. He has 1 fumble per 79.6 touches or 5 out of 398. He has only 1 fumble in the past 159 touches.

Durability: No significant issues. 
 
Pre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: I’ve seen chatter on social media about Wright as RB1 in fantasy drafts. It still likely 
means a second-round value—probably no later than mid-second. Pre-draft, I’m not interested in any back that high unless 
it’s Jonathan Brooks. Post-Draft, you could talk me into it with a good team fit.

RB Dillon Johnson RSP Scouting Profile

The Elevator Pitch: You scout long enough; you develop self-awareness about what appeals to you most in a player. For 
running backs, I gravitate toward runners with contact balance, downhill aggression, efficient and dynamic footwork, and 
creativity in and out of structure.  
This is what I gravitate toward and not exactly what the RSP process prioritizes above all else. If I simply allowed what I 
valued most from runners to dictate my process, I’d be guilty far more often than I have been with overvaluing runners 
lacking the requisite explosion to perform as consistent NFL starters.  
While I have been guilty of this from time to time, more often than not, runners like Spencer Ware, LeGarrette Blount, and 
Peyton Barber have outperformed much faster backs in the NFL whom the masses rated much higher. I learned to stick to 
my guns on this because I downgraded Arian Foster due to his timed speed after LOVING what I saw from him on tape at 
Tennessee and regret it to this day.  
The downfall of this approach is that you can overvalue a player’s speed and acceleration just enough that they can’t crack 
a starting lineup. At this point, Trey Sermon is looking like most recent player to fit this description.  
Johnson is a prospect this year who best fits this archetype that I gravitate toward personally and his speed and 
acceleration is the tipping point for his evaluation. Johnson has similar height, timed speed, and vertical as Foster. Like 
Foster, Johnson is a tough runner with strong pre-snap and post-snap decision-making and pass-catching skills but has 
endured characterizations attributed by their head coaches of not being tough enough.  
If Johnson’s explosion is as projected in this report, he could spend his career as an off-the-bench contributor who can 
deliver production when called upon due to a starter’s injury. If Johnson’s explosion is worse than projected, he might 
bounce around the NFL looking for a shot to prove that he’s worth keeping as a reserve.  
If Johnson is more explosive than measured and playing the end of the year foot, ankle, and leg injuries is a logical reason 
to be open-minded—so are multiple RFID measurements during Johnson’s career where he reached top speeds between 
20.5-21.6 mph—the rest of his game could make him one of the top-two RBs in this class and an instant starter talent.  
Johnson plays fast. He reads leverage well, anticipates penetrating defenders, manages situational football well as a runner, 
and attacks downhill aggressively. He also has the power, contact balance, and footwork solutions of a starter.  
There’s a recording of a phone call on YouTube that’s of Mike Leach saying he was glad Johnson was leaving Mississippi 
State because Johnson wasn’t very tough—a characterization Johnson verified and noted on SI and ESPN when he 
announced his transfer from the school. Leach is beloved among the coaching community and while he once was the center 
of a controversy involving his handling of Craig James’s son, it appeared Leach’s alleged harsh treatment was 
mischaracterized.  
That said, Johnson’s tape doesn’t look like that of a player who lacks toughness. He played hurt for much of the 2023 
season and played well, including Washington’s playoff run.  
Johnson is a smart, tough, versatile, and powerful runner. If he plays fast enough, regardless of his timed speed, watch out.

What is the best scheme fit? Jim Harbaugh and Greg Roman’s ground game with the Chargers. A back up to Zamir White 
with a shot of taking over when White’s contract expires. The heir apparent to David Montgomery in Detroit. A B-Back in an 
offense that runs heavy personnel in base sets who might earn a shot to be the A-Z back if he exceeds expectation.  
What is his ceiling scenario? One of the surprises of the RB class as a productive NFL starter with a long career.  
What is his floor scenario? Journeyman reserve.  
Physical: Top-tier power and strong contact balance.   
Technical: Johnson drops his head into the contact as a part of his attempt to deliver an uppercut strike. Although he 
handles linebackers effectively off the edge at the college level who don’t have strong counters, his punches must improve. 
Defenders with good hand counters can work around Johnson quickly because he drops his head. 
Conceptual: Johnson makes effective pre-snap reads of box defenders and adjusts accordingly as a runner.   
Intuitive: He’s an efficient mover who can create space by making defenders miss or running through them. He doesn’t 
have much confusion about when to do which.  
Build: Average size for a lead back and could potentially add weight to become the average size of a feature back. 
Vision: Johnson presses within one step of his blockers on runs between the tackles or the edge of the box. He’s slow to 
the hole and fast through it with zone blocking. He’s decisive with attacking tight creases.  
Johnson identifies penetration and dips across the face of the defender to find the open crease against the flow of the 
penetration. He’ll also dip past two defenders penetrating the intended crease on a gap play. He’ll even stick with the play 
design and press toward the defenders before making a move.  
When working Power, Johnson remains tight to his puller as he works through the crease. This helps him maintain distance 
from back side pursuit at the line or in the second level. When obvious, Johnson will access cutbacks on gap plays, taking 
what he can earn and staying tight to his lead block to maximize space from the backside pursuit.  
Johnson also identifies pre-snap tells for run blitzes up the middle and makes a timely adjustment to press the blitzer and 
dip away. He reads the leverage of defenders to find open creases on Duo and Inside Zone. 
Johnson skillfully presses and bounces inside-out on gap plays to the perimeter such as Power and Toss. He can turn around 
linebackers at the edge of the defense with his presses.  
In three games studied, I saw one bad decision—a bounce on Counter where he should have continued between his two 
pullers.  
In the open field, Johnson has the peripheral vision to spot backside pursuit and makes timely decisions to dip away from it.  
Elusiveness: Johnson varies his stride length to set up cutbacks into open space. He points the toe to the boundary to 
open his hips near the line of scrimmage to generate an efficient bounce or cut. Johnson can jump-cut into the hip-opener 
move. 
Johnson has an effective stick to help him press downhill toward a run blitz and then dip away.  He can duck under 
cornerbacks reaching for him at the line of scrimmage.  
When leaving his feet while running backward to attack a target in the passing game, Johnson only needs two quick steps to 
transition from retreating on a perimeter path to accelerating downhill.  
Johnson has sharp and efficient pressure cuts in the open field to sidestep pursuit that’s coming downhill for him. He also 
has good curvilinear speed to bend downhill inside a containment option at the edge of the box.  
When not using curvilinear movement, Johnson only needs one step to transition downhill at a good rate of speed from an 
approach toward the boundary as he reaches the edge of the box. When working outside the box, he only needs two small 
steps.  
Johnson has the efficiency of movement to work past two points of penetration from the same side of the box on a gap 
play.

Acceleration: Johnson has the acceleration to easily beat a linebacker to the far-side flat. He can also beat a cornerback 
downfield who’s in the short-side flat on a cutback and about 5-7 yards over the top of Johnson. His initial acceleration is 
notable.  
When working up the middle, a safety will catch Johnson when Johnson earns a free run through the defense, but it will 
take 30-45 yards for the safety to reach Johnson after he has turned to pursue. He accelerates past safeties, but he doesn’t 
maintain the long speed.  
Speed: Johnson can beat some safeties deep in the secondary, but he’s more likely to be chased down after 30-45 yards. 
Johnson has reached maximum speeds on RFID timing of 21.6 miles per hour.  
Power: Johnson can pull through the reaches to his legs from linebackers. With his size and acceleration, Johnson 
generates the momentum to pull defensive linemen 2-3 yards downhill when wrapped from the side or behind.  
Johnson kicks his heels toward his backside when pulling through reaches and wraps to his feet and lower legs.  
When Johnson has momentum, he can carry 2-3 defenders 10-15 yards downfield in the secondary. He finishes with good 
pad level, attacking defenders downhill.  
Johnson has a stiff arm with good range to ward off reaches from defenders in open space as he turns the corner and gets 
downhill. He also delivers a forearm shiver in tight quarters and can work through hits from linebackers.  
Johnson can work through multiple tackle attempts during a run—mostly reaches and a glancing shot—but he can also drag 
or push defenders when finishing these touches. Johnson runs with excellent pad level between the tackles.  
Direct Contact Balance: He can knock a safety backward with his pad level and push when meeting the defender in the 
hole. He stalemates middle linebackers on I-formation Toss when he and the defender have equal momentum downhill. He 
can also stalemate a defensive end meeting him head on in the open field and neither have more than 1-2 steps into the 
collision point.  
Indirect Contact Balance: He attacks with his pads in the open field, initiating contact and bouncing off safeties up the 
boundary. Johnson bounces off hits to his legs from cornerbacks when running downhill.  
When splitting a defensive tackle and linebacker at the line of scrimmage, Johnson can bounce off the linebacker and push 
the tackle backward. Johnson routinely bounces off hits to his side from linebackers.  
Johnson has an effective balance touch through lower-leg contact.  
Routes: Johnson tempos his breaks cross zones to maximize his availability for his quarterback. He identifies the second-
level defender, works to depth, and settles into the open area when working routes that break to the quarterback.  
Against off-man coverage, Johnson has a sudden double up at the top of his stem. His speed breaks are flat and he angles 
back to the quarterback out of the drive and line steps. He gets his head around fast to present a friendly target. Johnson 
has a nice hesitation at the top of a stem.  
Receiving: Johnson uses overhand position for chest-high target and underhand position for belt-line targets or lower. He 
makes the difficult layout for a high target away from his frame and over his shoulder with overhand position, embracing 
the fall so he doesn’t land on the ball.  
Johnson transitions with catch and pierce technique and obeys the direction of the ball. He can take a hit to his back just 
after catching the ball while transitioning downhill with his turn.  
Blocking: Johnson identifies interior pressure and has the size, position, tight hands, and bent elbows to stifle a defensive 
tackle when he’s the first to attack and eliminates the air between his frame and the defender’s.  
Johnson works inside-out against edge pressure with a wide and squat stance. He slides with the defender and has tight 
enough hands with good elbow bend to work into the opponent’s chest.  
Johnson drops his head into the contact as a part of his attempt to deliver an uppercut strike. Although he handles 
linebackers effectively off the edge at the college level who don’t have strong counters, his punches must improve. 
Defenders with good hand counters can work around Johnson quickly because he drops his head. 


Text from page 264:
 
76 
When Johnson is a lead blocker or facing a smaller defender, Johnson can punch and roll though his hips despite dropping 
his head to begin the interaction. He gets walked back into the pocket by linebackers and defensive ends.  
Johnson works across the formation to square and cut linebackers. He earns good height with the cut, works across the 
frame, and has appropriate timing while keeping his head up. He must close the gap better so he can shoot through the 
opponent. When this doesn’t happen, the defender can get his hands on Johnson and push the runner to the ground before 
Johnson’s shot works through the opponent’s body. 
Ball Security: Johnson has 4 fumbles in 640 touches – 1 per 160. He carries the ball high and tight to his chest and can 
take contact to the ball. The arm does not move much when he carries the ball and when he finishes, he’ll get a second arm 
around it. He leads with the non-ball shoulder when finishing with a collision.  
Durability: A November foot fracture to his right foot in 2023 that he aggravated during the final possession of the college 
playoff semifinal game, returning for the championship game a week later. He also hurt his knee in that game—a ruptured 
bursa.  
 
Knee injury at Mississippi State in spring practice that required surgery and re-injured it at Washington in 2023 but played 
through it. No injuries requiring missed games.  
 
Pre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Fantasy GMs will likely value Johnson at the end of dynasty drafts if not as a free agent. 
His NFL Draft capital will likely reinforce this. If your draft has at least 6-8 rounds, Johnson is worth taking in those final two 
rounds depending on roster size, IDP scoring, and the IDP options available. He’s one of my candidates that I believe will be 
underrated and will work his way into a roster spot and eventually playing time.

RB Kimani Vidal RSP Scouting Profile 
 
RSP Ranking: RB5 
Jersey: No.28 
Height/Weight: 5’8”/213 School: Troy 
Comparison Spectrum: Maurice Jones-Drew – Ahmad Bradshaw – X/D’Andre Swift – Jaylen Warren 
 
Depth of Talent Score: 83.1 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. 
 
Games Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): 
• 
Kansas State ‘23 
• 
WKU ‘23

The Elevator Pitch: Vidal has similar physical dimensions and physical strengths as D’Andre Swift. Their RSP grades are 
similar, but I had more difficulty gauging Swift’s explosion. If I were a touch more accurate, Vidal would have the higher 
grade in hindsight because he’s a smarter runner. Unlike many backs with his combination of size, speed, and quickness, 
Vidal errs on the conservative side of managing risk with carries in the red zone or backed up deep in his own territory.  
He’s a versatile runner with competency working behind gap and zone blocking. He’s a little better with gap running at this 
point, but only because he can press a step deeper on specific zone runs to get more from the play.  
Vidal maximizes his low center of gravity with efficient and dynamic movement. He has the footwork and hip mobility to 
execute a variety of jump stops and jump-cuts but also knows how to open his hips with minimal steps toward pursuit. He 
accelerates in and out of jump-cuts, which he applies well as a method of transitioning downhill on off-tackle runs and 
bounces to the edge.  
Vidal has no problem beating box defenders through open creases or around the edge on reasonably blocked plays. When 
he can freeze an unblocked defender with movement, he can also accelerate past.  
Like a lot of short players with good size, Vidal runs upright between the tackles and doesn’t maximize the benefit of his 
size. Still, Vidal sheds wraps from linemen and linebackers.  
A smarter and more powerful runner than Swift, Vidal is also a superior blocker. He has minor improvements to make as a 
receiver with his technique at the catch point. His route usage at Troy was basic and he didn’t show enough to indicate he 
knew more than what was asked of him as a route runner. 
While Vidal has more promise on film than what I saw from Swift, Vidal was a smart and versatile runner on a good team in 
the SBC conference—not the SEC. This won’t translate well to the resume-oriented mentality of decision-makers who make 
valuation decisions with draft capital.  
Because Vidal and Swift are contributor-level talents rather than legit franchise backs, draft capital makes a big difference 
for opportunity. Swift earned the capital due to a combination of his talents, his school, his production, and the recent 
lineage of excellent backs that came out of Athens.  
It’s unlikely that Vidal earns those opportunities and that increases his chances of being a Day Three acquisition with a 
tougher road to haul that includes overcoming the politics of rigged training camp competitions that don’t place all draft 
picks on equal footing that occur with many NFL teams.  
Overall Vidal has the power and contact balance to hold up as an interior runner in at least a committee capacity. It’s 
doubtful that he can add another 8-10 pounds to his frame but if he can do so and maintain his athletic prowess, he might 
transcend a committee role and earn a feature role if a true opportunity presents itself.    
Where is the player inconsistent? His hand positions with attacking targets in the receiving game needs refinement.  
What is the best scheme fit? For immediate impact, Vidal could function in D’Andre Swift’s roles that we saw in Detroit 
and Philadelphia immediately and with greater diversity of plays that coaches could scheme for Swift. The Colts, Chargers, 
and Raiders come to mind immediately as potential options.

78 
What is his ceiling scenario? A feature back who can deliver on all four-down downs, but the odds of reaching this tier is 
remote due to the nature of the NFL. He could earn a lead role in a committee for a year or two and depending on his health 
and the strength of future classes, we’ll see if he keeps it or is made the second option to a new teammate with higher draft 
capital and more feature back promise.   
What is his floor scenario? A reserve with limited contributions behind players with higher draft capital.  
Physical: A sturdily built back with strength, explosion, and lateral movement.  
Technical: Vidal has some slight overextension at the strike point when blocking. If he eliminates this bad habit, he has the 
rest of the skills to excel as a pass protector.   
Conceptual: Vidal errs on the conservative side of bouncing or cutting back runs when in scenarios where coaches are 
concerned about keeping the playbook expanded. This is a good place to err as a runner.  
Intuitive: Vidal moves incrementally to influence blitz angles as a pass protector. This dissuades some blitzers from 
continuing before they even make contact with Vidal.  
Build: Short, but not small. 
Vision: Vidal identifies penetration from a blitzing linebacker as the defender reaches the crease from the second level and 
dips outside the interior disruptor. With zone runs, Vidal presses within two steps of the line and finds the bounce or cutback 
lane. With off-tackle runs, he can press within a step of the line or the unblocked defender.  
With gap runs, Vidal presses the puller’s position to work back to the inside shoulder on Power. He can find the cutback lane 
on Counter. He’s knowledgeable with Gap and Zone blocking.  
He might be too conservative versus penetration on short-yardage plays where he has room to bounce, but he’s managing 
the situation well for his team.  
Elusiveness: Vidal only needs two steps to transition downhill form a perimeter approach that takes him outside the 
numbers from the middle of the field. Vidal can finish a transition with an effective jump-cut to make a box defender miss 
with their back-side pursuit down the line.  
Vidal can jump stop into a pressure cut that gets him inside a defensive back’s position outside and over the top of him.  
Vidal can come to a quick stop within two steps after approaching the line seven yards downhill and avoid a linebacker 
shooting the gap. He can also accelerate through the crease toward the flat and make a jump stop outside and accelerate 
inside that is essentially a one-step cut downhill at full speed.  
When pressing deep into the line, Vidal can point the toe to the boundary and bounce/cutback at a 90-degree angle. Vidal 
can reverse field from one edge of the box to the other.  
Acceleration: Vidal is quick enough to avoid an unblocked blitzing linebacker through the A Gap. He can beat a defensive 
end to the flats.  
When working up the middle, he can beat near-side box defenders downhill as well as a shallow cornerback in the flat, 
flipping the field in the process.  
When working to the near-side flat on a perimeter run, Vidal can beat a safety to the corner and turn up-field on him.  
Speed: The far-side safety playing high can run down Vidal to the opposite boundary 30 yards after he begins his pursuit. 
Vidal can flip the field in that time.  
Power: Vidal has enough reach with his stiff arm to force defenders to shoot low. When a defensive lineman wraps Vidal 
high head-on, Vidal can use his low center of gravity to generate a push downhill.  
Vidal can also shed high wraps from defensive linemen because of his leverage and an effective stiff arm.  
Although a short player, he ran upright in two of the games I studied. He can drop his pads into contact but doesn’t run 
with the lean that lends itself to low pad level when colliding with a defender in the crease.  


Text from page 267:
 
79 
Vidal can pull through multiple reaches during a run. He can bounce off a hit to his lower leg and force gang tackles. If not 
gang tackled, Vidal can keep his feet between the tackles and have his teammates push him forward.  
Direct Contact Balance: Vidal can generate a push downhill after colliding with a linebacker in a crease. He can stalemate 
a hard hit from a linebacker coming downhill fast in the flat, forcing a wrap.  
Indirect Contact Balance: Vidal has an effective balance-touch through wrap attempts to his legs. He can bounce off hits 
to his upper and lower legs from defensive tackles, linebackers, and safeties.  
Routes: Vidal runs short in-cuts at half or three-quarter speed. He has sharp drive and line steps to cultivate a flat break.  
He identifies the second-level defender in zone coverage, works to depth, and settles into the open area with a friendly 
position for his quarterback.  
Receiving: Vidal uses a mixed attack with one high and one low to clap attack on targets at his numbers on stop routes. He 
can use overhand attack with targets at shoulder height and track the ball over his shoulder while doing it.  
He also uses underhand attack with targets on the numbers when working away from the target. Vidal can turn behind his 
break path to catch the ball with underhand attack at the back hip while on the move.  
When he uses overhand attack, his hands can be tighter so there isn’t a small clap attack.  
Vidal incorporates catch-and-pierce technique to transition downhill and he’s mindful of the location of the defender playing 
above him in the zone.  
Blocking: Vidal identifies interior pressure through the A or B Gaps. He could get deeper into the pocket when he sets up, 
but he sets up with a square and squat stance. He has a slight dip of the head as the defender draws close, but there’s not 
much overextension. 
Vidal delivers his hands with his elbows bent and uses an uppercut motion with hip roll through the strike when he doesn’t 
get caught during his slight overextension. His hands are tight enough to reach the chest of the defender and Vidal moves 
his feet just enough to push the opponent outside the quarterback’s spot in the pocket.  
As an edge protector, he identifies linebacker blitzes and incrementally works inside-out to force the defender to work 
outside. Vidal maintains a square and squat position as he shuffles his feet laterally and can influence linebackers to 
discontinue their rush or decrease the intensity of their effort.  
He can anchor his position against strikes from linebackers and redirect his efforts after the first contact. He can push 
around defensive backs blitzing off the edge and stone them on safety blitzes with a long runway up the middle.  
Vidal chips edge defenders before releasing to the flats. He delivers a strike that’s substantial but not one that knocks 
defenders off the primary blocker.  
He can overrun linebacker or safety pressure on sprint passes and must show more patience with inside position. Vidal can 
also miss green dawg blitzes. When a safety shows late pre-snap that he’s threatening an inside gap, Vidal should make the 
adjustment rather than carry out the play fake and miss the blitz by a step.  
Vidal cut blocks linebackers off the edge with good timing. He delivers across the frame with enough height that when he 
shoots through the defender, he takes the man’s legs out. He also gets his head up when shooting so his strike is working 
upward through the defender.  
Ball Security: Vidal carries the ball close to his chest and under his boundary-side arm. He can take reaches, rips, and 
swats to the ball or ball-carrying arm.  
Vidal has 7 fumbles in 875 career touches, a rate of 1 per 125. Last year, he fumbled 2 in 297, a rate of 1 per 148.5 and for 
the past two years with 494 touches, his rate is 1 per 164.67. 
Durability: No significant injuries reported.

Pre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Vidal epitomizes the reason there’s an RSP Pre-Draft and Post-Draft. Pre-draft, his talent 
deserves highlighting. Post-draft will account for the variable of draft capital, which is mistaken as a predictor of talent 
instead of a reinforcer of the NFL Decision-Making Matrix.  
 
This means Vidal is likely a Day Three selection or UDFA signing with more talent and game-ready skills than his status will 
suggest. If it plays out as predicted, you can consider Vidal in the fourth round or later in April fantasy drafts and possibly 
later after the NFL enforces its Matrix.

RB Will Shipley RSP Scouting Profile 
 
RSP Ranking: RB7 
Jersey: No.1 
Height/Weight: 5’11”/206 School: Clemson  
Comparison Spectrum: Austin Ekeler/Kenny Irons – X/Bilal Powell – Ronald Jones – Jake Funk

The Elevator Pitch: Shipley is one of the two best receiving backs in this class and has the potential to become a lead back 
or starter on the strength of his receiving skills. He doesn’t play quite to his timed speed from his Clemson Pro Day, but the 
home cooking of a college’s track is usually baked into scout’s evaluation of this facet of a player’s game.  
What’s more valuable about Shipley’s game is his acceleration and lateral movement. Shipley uses both physical skills 
effectively as a route runner against underneath coverage and up the seams on vertical-breaking routes. He’s a skilled 
manipulator of off-coverage or trail coverage with vertical routes and finishes stems with effective hand counters to 
defender contact so he can maintain position. 
Shipley tracks the ball well as a receiver and makes late athletic adjustments to earn the target with a position that 
prevents tight coverage from making a good play on the ball. Winning against contact is not a problem for Shipley.  
The receiving game is where Shipley will make an early impact as a player. However, it’s not the only part of his game that 
matters.  
Shipley has a notably quick processor of what’s developing at the line of scrimmage. One of the best things he does as an 
inside runner is setup double teams and split them. He’s also skilled and athletic cutback runner with light feet and a well-
integrated movements with his upper and lower body to defeat pursuit angles.  
Although power and contact balance isn’t the strength of Shipley’s game, his technique, effort, movement skills, are all good 
enough that Shipley could perform better between the tackles than many scouting reports may characterize. The proviso is 
that Shipley has the frame to add muscle and at least maintain his current athletic prowess. 
If so, Shipley could be the case of a heralded high school player who has a better pro career than college career. Shipley’s 
skills on film indicate a strong possibility that his buzz faded because he signed with an ACC powerhouse whose 
quarterbacks disappointed and stunted the offense.  
If Shipley gets stronger, maintains his explosion, and lands on a team that can leverage his receiving skills in a high-
powered offense, he could emerge as one of the most productive options in this class. If he’s regarded as a role player, then 
you’re looking at a more explosive Bilal Powell or Kenneth Gainwell, who can deliver production in a lead role when called 
upon but the team will have doubts about his upside in a long-term feature role. 
Where is the player inconsistent? There are some opportunities for Shipley to follow the leverage read and take the ball 
into tight creases, but he knows when to abandon the tight crease for the quick and easy yards against an unblocked 
defender in a short-yardage situation where the more patient approach would have made the necessary gain more difficult 
even if the net yardage potential was greater.   
What is the best scheme fit? A wide-zone scheme would work well for him as a runner if he can earn an opportunity to 
develop into a lead back. If he’s used more as a complement or a high-end committee lead, a combination of gap and wide 
zone that the Jaguars have used with Travis Etienne would also work.  
If the Saints are seeking an eventual replacement for Alvin Kamara to pair with Kendre Miller as the big back, Shipley could 
be worth consideration. His receiving skills will likely make him an in-demand option in the fourth or fifth round.   
What is his ceiling scenario? Shipley becomes a lead back and top producer due to his versatility.  


Text from page 270:
 
82 
What is his floor scenario? Shipley becomes a complementary contributor or reserve with value in the return game and 
two-minute offense.  
Physical: If Shipley can get stronger and more explosive, he could transcend a receiving-back label.  
Technical: Shipley has good pad level and knows how to work under hits and maximize yards after contact.  
Conceptual: His understanding of how to set up vertical-breaking routes. 
Intuitive: Shipley has a notably quick processor of information in the middle of the field.  
Build: Average size for a scatback but might have more weight to add.  
Vision: Shipley presses creases within 1-2 steps of his blockers before accessing the bounce or cutback lane. Shipley sets 
up his pullers with the angle of his approach on Counter. He’s not afraid to cutback a gap play if the leverage reads indicate 
that choice is the best course of action.  
There are some opportunities for Shipley to follow the leverage read and take the ball into tight creases, but he knows when 
abandon the tight crease for the quick and easy yards against an unblocked defender in a short-yardage situation where the 
more patient approach would have made the necessary gain more difficult even if the net yardage potential was greater.   
He understands how to scrape the backs of blockers on cutbacks so he’s limiting the pursuit range of the backside defender 
working down the line and getting past the opponent into the hole. He’s a skilled tight-crease runner who can vary stride 
length and pace with great facility while executing micromovements with his upper body to make opponents miss in 
confines where he appears dead to rights.  
Shipley has a notably quick processor of what’s developing at the line of scrimmage. One of the best things he does as an 
inside runner is setup double teams and split them.  
Elusiveness: Shipley adjusts his stride length and/or pacing to press creases and set up cutbacks or bounces. He has an 
effective spin move at the end of a crease that will at least force a safety to slide down Shipley’s frame to wrap low and give 
Shipley room to fall forward.  
He has flexible hips to point the toe to the boundary and make a 90-degree turn within tight quarters of pursuit arriving 
over the top.  
Shipley has a quick stutter to set up a defensive back in the open field to take a bad angle and then steps over or bends the 
low shot with high knees and feet. He displays high knees and feet to get over low shots as well.  
Shipley only needs 1-2 quick steps to transition from a perimeter runway to a downhill runway. He layers moves well 
against pursuit from over the top. He can deliver a stutter-shake with a hip-opener to get outside the defender.  
Acceleration: Shipley has effective first-step acceleration to work past penetration deep into the backfield and within 1-2 
steps of Shipley’s exchange point with the quarterback. He can reach the far-side boundary, beating defensive linemen 
around the corner. He can beat linebackers and safeties to the far-side edge.   
When he gets the corner on box defenders, he’s often the recipient of an option toss. He can beat a safety up the seam on a 
deep post.  
Speed: Shipley can hold off a safety in the secondary when he earns separation against a bad angle by the safety, or the 
safety is coming from the opposite side of the field. He’s going to beat a cornerback who pursues from the same side of the 
field and has a good angle. His field speed doesn’t show up as well as his Pro Day speed did—surprise, surprise. 
Power: Shipley runs with a good lean with his pads over his knees and keeps his feet moving through contact. He can run 
through reaches to his upper body from defensive linemen. He’ll use his free arm to shake loose from the reach of the 
defender.  
Shipley can win reaches against linebacker by dropping his pads and using his stiff-arm to ward off or push off the defender. 
When he keeps his pads low, which he usually does, he can help his team generate a push in traffic.  
Direct Contact Balance: Shipley can stalemate a linebacker in the hole.  When he has a downhill crease and a runway, he 
can spin off the stalemate and force the defender to wrap as Shipley leans downhill.  


Text from page 271:
 
83 
Indirect Contact Balance: Shipley can bounce off indirect contact from linebackers and safeties onto his frame.  
Routes: Shipley will identify the second-level defender, work to depth, and snap his turns back to the quarterback in the 
open zone. He’ll also find the open zone during a scramble drill and present a good target for the passer. He doesn’t show 
his eyes until he has cleared the buzz or rollover defender.  
Against off-man coverage, Shipley will use his head and eyes to sell movement that doesn’t come. He will reduce his 
shoulder as he works inside or outside the coverage to mitigate contact at the top of his stems.  
He’ll use the peek technique to sell routes at the top of his stem as well as stair-step his stems to set up off-coverage. 
Shipley also uses stem manipulation with widening, narrowing, or running at defenders during the stem to set up 
opponents. He’ll also use pace variations. 
At the top of stems, Shipley uses release techniques such as sheds and swats at to accompany a crossover or hip shift.  He 
has a nice hesitation at the top of steps to set up a break inside.  
He reads the coverage of zone defenders to adjust routes that don’t break open into decisions that can become big plays 
downfield.  
Receiving: Shipley has the hand-eye coordination to attack targets behind his break path at the back shoulder and with 
overhand position above his head without leaving his feet unless necessary. He transitions immediately downfield after the 
catch with strong catch-and-pierce technique.  
He tracks the ball over his shoulder and makes catches over his shoulder on vertical routes with full extension of his arms 
and uses overhand position away from his frame to do so.  
Shipley uses the appropriate hands position based on the location of the target. He can highpoint and win the target as he’s 
taking a hard shot to the chest while securing the ball to his frame. He can earn an underthrown target on a post and take 
contact to his back.  
He had one target against FSU where he used high-low position to catch a target close to his chest. He embraces the fall so 
he doesn’t land on the ball.  
Blocking: Shipley slides to the edge and uses his forearm and/or shoulder to deliver a chip as part of a double-team of an 
edge defender. The strike is hard enough to slow the defender but not knock the defender off the block of Shipley’s 
teammate. Shipley will also follow up with another strike if he’s not releasing into a route.  
Shipley has good timing with cut blocks against linebackers blitzing the A- or B-Gaps. He will work across the defender with 
good height. He doesn’t keep his head up, dropping his pads to his knees, making contact with the defender, and then 
raising his shoulders upward. If he kept his head up and shot through the contact, he wouldn’t risk a back injury because he 
wouldn’t be performing a back-lift of the defender.  
When employing a standup technique, Shipley shuffles his feet quickly to earn a square position against linebackers and/or 
safeties threatening the gap. He also leads and seals safeties well to the inside after initial contact head-on.  
He’s not a puncher with the uppercut, but he drops his shoulder, delivers a strike and pivots off that strike. He moves his 
feet after the strike to stay with the opponent and attempt to move him around the pocket. However, he can get beaten to 
the punch because he leads with his shoulder. When this happens, the defender generates enough of a push that Shipley 
loses the first-strike advantage of movement that could push the opponent away from the quarterback.  
He can miss edge pressure and have confusion about which blitzer is his assignment—the inside pressure between the 
tackles and the defender outside the tackles. Shipley spots interior pressure and earns enough position to force the 
defender wide of the quarterback even if he reaches for the opponent rather than striking.  
Ball Security: Shipley carries the ball tight to his chest. He uses the boundary-side arm based on the direction of the play 
design. He can take contact to the ball from pursuing defenders.  
Durability: No significant injuries to report. Injured knee in bowl game late this year against Florida, but no structural 
damage found.

Pre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Shipley’s value could rise significantly in fantasy drafts if he earns Day Two NFL Draft 
capital. I don’t know the likelihood of it happening based on what I saw but with  the resume-bullet mentality of decision-
makers, there’s a chance. He’s a solid third- or fourth-round fantasy selection in April dynasty formats.

RB Dyan Laube RSP Scouting Profile 
 
RSP Ranking: RB8 
Jersey: No.20 
Height/Weight: 5’10”/206 School: New Hampshire  
Comparison Spectrum: Brian Westbrook - - X/Duke Johnson - Sean Tucker - Johnny White 
Depth of Talent Score: 82.7 = Rotational Starter: Executes at a starter level in a role playing to their strengths. 
Games Tracked (Opponent/Date/Link): 
• 
Western Michigan ‘22 
• 
Central Michigan ‘23 
• 
Villanova ‘23 
 
The Elevator Pitch: Laube’s small-school status will make him a curiosity for fans and media, but he’s a legitimate talent 
with refined skills as a runner between the tackles and in the open field. He has an ingrained link between what his eyes see 
and how his feet react, especially between the tackles.  
Laube presses creases deep enough to set up unblocked defenders into blocks with a variety of schemes. He’s competent 
with plays that work inside and out with both zone and gap blocking. When Laube identifies penetration into the backfield, 
he doesn’t overreact with a bounce or a cutback when the best option is to change his stride length, allow the defender to 
pass, and continue downhill—often into the space that the penetrating defender left open.  
Laube understands how to use his movement skills and tight presses to initiate contact with unblocked defenders as a way 
of setting up movement away from the pursuit. Good NFL starters initiate chains of movement. When forced to react to an 
opponent’s initiation, they figure out counters that re-establish control of the movement chain. Laube possesses this ability 
to enough of a degree that he’s effective between the tackles and in the open field.  
These skills are vital to Laube’s game because at his size, he’s a technically functional runner rather than a powerful runner. 
Even if Laube’s game doesn’t translate completely to the NFL as an interior runner, his skills as a receiver are on pair with 
Will Shipley as the two best pass catchers from the backfield in this class.  
Laube isn’t as explosive as Shipley but he’s the best route runner in this class. From zone routes underneath to all depth 
and types of routes against man-to-man, Shipley is efficient, well-versed with manipulation techniques, and executes routes 
with an artistry that a lot of receivers in this class still need to learn.  
Look for Laube to impress enough as receiver to earn reps in a two-minute offense and build on his game from there. He’s a 
smart runner and if he can hold up and prove explosive enough for the team that drafts him, he could become a weekly 
contributor with legitimate volume in the right passing game.  
Where has the player improved? Laube’s overall ball security track record is just below the starter tier but last year, 
Laube went from his worst season to his best with an elite rate of holding onto the ball.  
Where is the player inconsistent? Laube carries the ball high to his chest and uses the boundary-side arm, but has 
lapses with plays working to the right side. His lapses aren’t frequent. 
What is the best scheme fit? A spread offense where Laube can earn the ball on RPOs, screens, draws, and on timing 
routes detached from the formation and in the backfield.  
What is his ceiling scenario? Laube proves effective between the tackles and becomes a lead back in the NFL who earns 
nearly equal volume as a runner and receiver that translates to 1,500-1,700 total yards and double-digit scores.  
What is his floor scenario? Laube is a reserve or a passing-down role player with minimal volume in an offense that isn’t 
best-suited for him and he’s labeled a reserve/role-player for the rest of his career.  
Physical: He’s not large enough or strong enough at this time to win collisions with safeties who aren’t flat-footed at the 
point of attack.   
Technical: He overextends into linebackers and that can put him at a disadvantage compared to the benefit of delivering a 
well-timed punch. He gets pushed back a few steps into the pocket from linebackers because he doesn’t strike. He has an 
uppercut position with his arms, but doesn’t throw his hands.

86 
Conceptual: Laube presses creases well between the tackles.  
Intuitive: He’s a fast processor of information who adjust his upper and lower body to minimize or avoid contact. He also 
adjusts to establish contact and leverage the contact to his advantage.  
Build: Average for a scat back.  
Vision: Laube is good at pressing rushing lanes to draw unblocked defenders into blockers or the wrong crease, which helps 
him maximize yardage. He takes what the defense gives him without attempting risky cutbacks or bounces.  
He runs gap and zone schemes competently. On wind back, Laube presses the crease within a step of blockers and can 
efficiently cutback or bounce.  
Laube finds cutbacks on gap and zone plays. When cutting back into a crease, he does a strong job of staying tight to the 
inside blocker so he maximizes space from pursuit.  
When he bounces a play to the far boundary, he can press inside, ride the wave of blockers to the first outside gap, and 
then press the outside pursuit into the gap before sliding to the open edge.  
He identifies penetration during the exchange and has the quickness and control of his feet to avoid interior or edge 
penetration and reach an open gap. His first reaction isn’t to bounce or cutback. He’ll also make the defender miss with an 
efficient stop-start move and head downhill, especially when the game scenario dictates wise management and low risk.  
Elusiveness: Laube adjusts his stride length and pace to set up rushing lanes. He dips and bends around obstacles. He has 
good upper-body movement, reducing the shoulder from reaches as he works through a crease at the line of scrimmage. 
Whether he’s moving north-south or east-west, Laube shakes reaches from linebackers, defensive ends, and defensive 
tackles with this technique. Laube understands how to initiate contact to set up a spin off the collision and earn a lot more 
into open space.  
Laube can point the toe and open the hips to make efficient changes of direction in traffic. He can also spin away from 
contact. Laube only needs two quick steps to transition 90 degrees at top speed.  
Acceleration: Laube has the acceleration to gain the short edge on a corner and he can pull away from the near-side 
safety playing 10-12 yards off the line and chasing Laube to the boundary. He can beat a linebacker around the far-side 
edge.  
Speed: Laube has the speed to beat a safety deep who is playing a seven-yard cushion. He can outrun cornerbacks on the 
same side of the field.   
Power: Laube has a capable stiff-arm to ward off cornerbacks reaches. Laube finishes runs in the open field with good pad 
level and initiates contact, keeping his feet moving to push off-ball linebackers for extra yardage.  
He finishes with good lean and can earn another 2-3 yards when wrapped from behind by linebackers and/or linemen.  
Direct Contact Balance: As he emerges from the crease, Laube will drop his pads into a flat-footed safety and run through 
the contact. He will stalemate some inside linebackers, but he’s not large/strong enough to routinely win these collisions in 
the NFL.  
Indirect Contact Balance: Laube can win indirect collisions with off-ball linebackers when he has a runway outside or 
downhill and initiates the collision with his pads. He can lean through a wrap and hit from a large defensive tackle and fall 
forward for another 1-2 yards, keeping his feet moving another 2-3 steps. 
Routes: Laube works to depth after identifying the second-level defender and settles into the open space. When he’s 
running vertical routes against zone coverage, Laube doesn’t give his eyes to the quarterback until he passed the 
buzz/rollover defender. With these routes, he widens his stems and runs at the defender before breaking further inside. He 
can also dive inside to set up breaks.  
Laube has a patient but sudden double-up against man coverage as a wide receiver. He also has a patient but sudden read 
step. His stick has violence off the line. He can counter a defender’s hands with a wipe.  


Text from page 275:
 
87 
Against off coverage Laube uses a hesitation during his stem and a two-quick at the top of his stem to set up a break to the 
inside.  
Lauge executes tight drive and line steps with breaks inside on shallow in-cuts. His three-step break is sharp. He drops his 
weight fully into whip routes.  
Laube has good command of pacing as a route runner. He has a staggered stance with 80/20 weight distribution favoring 
his front leg. His arms hang uncrossed at either side of his front leg. When he releases, he rolls off the front foot. He should 
curtail the extra step off the back foot.  
He comes off the line with his pads over his knees, selling the potential for a vertical route. He can time his swat-swim 
combination better after he runs at the defender during his initial stem. He uses the swat well at the top of stems. Laube 
sells the peek effectively to set up the out and up.  
When on a vertical route, Laube frames the separation he has earned with the defender, keeping his arm between himself 
and the defender until it’s time to attack the ball. This is what top receivers do well.   
Receiving: Laube tracks the ball over his shoulder and catches the ball with underhand attack. He can jump for targets 
over his head that require a leap and catch and snatch with overhand attack. He can also track over his shoulder without 
leaving his feet to extend for a target over his head. He tracks the ball well enough to reach behind his back shoulder as 
he’s breaking downfield and attack the ball at its earliest point with tight overhand position. 
Laube can take a hard shot to his back after initially securing the ball.  
Laube uses underhand position in scenarios where overhand attack is the optimal approach. Laube has strong hand-eye 
coordination. He can make one-handed catches away from his frame with underhand position.  
Blocking: Laube earns depth in the pocket against blitzing linebackers, squares the target with a wide stance and squat 
position, and delivers his hands tight and with his elbows bent into the chest of the defender. 
He overextends into linebackers and that can put him at a disadvantage compared to the benefit of delivering a well-timed 
punch. He gets pushed back a few steps into the pocket from linebackers because he doesn’t strike. He has an uppercut 
position with his arms, but he doesn’t throw his hands.  
He identifies the cross-blitzing LB through the A-gap and earns good position. He slides to the edge to assist tackles at their 
outside shoulder.  
Ball Security: Laube carries the ball high to his chest and uses the boundary-side arm but has lapses with plays working to 
the right side. His lapses aren’t frequent. He often switches the ball on cutbacks when he hits the open field can clears the 
box. He can take contact to the ball or the ball-carrying arm from defensive linemen.  
Laube has 713 touches during his college career and 6 fumbles, 1 per 118.8 touches. 2022 was his worst season with 3 
fumbles in 294 touches – 1 per 98. He improved that rate in 2023 with 1 fumble in 226 touches.  
His elbow can get a little loose from his frame, but it often tightens in traffic.  
Durability: No significant injuries reported. Missed minimal time with nagging injuries during his career.  
 
Pre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Laube is one of the reasons you might get a value pick at the running back position 
between rounds 3-5 in fantasy drafts. Depending on name recognition, which will be small—and the opportunity to see tape 
even smaller—he’ll probably be available in rounds 4-5.

RB Blake Watson RSP Scouting Profile 
 
RSP Ranking: RB9 
Jersey: No.2 at ODU/No.4 in 2023 with Memphis 
Height/Weight: 5’9”/195 School: Old Dominion/Memphis 
Comparison Spectrum: Austin Ekeler – Giovani Bernard – X - Chase Edmonds

The Elevator Pitch: An all-purpose back, the big question with Watson is whether his ceiling is closer to Chase Edmond's 
NFL career or if he's in the neighborhood of Christian McCaffrey and Austin Ekeler.  
Watson has the decision-making prowess to develop into a productive NFL runner between the tackles for a zone or gap-
dominant scheme. He identifies problems early in the run and delivers efficient solutions.  
Agile and quick with a gliding quality to his acceleration, Watson lacks true power. Yet, he understands how to take on half 
of the defender's frame when forced to work in close quarters.  
He's most successful when he can use his stiff arm or lift his knees and feet away from reaches and shots to his lower body. 
Watson's high knees and feet should serve him well at the next level.  
So should his tracking of the football and hand-eye coordination in the receiving game. Watson wins targets in the vertical 
game, including contested catches where must earn an advantageous position on his coverage.  
These are skills he has in common with the likes of Ekeler, McCaffrey, and Aaron Jones. Like this trio, Watson must prove he 
can develop into an NFL-caliber route runner. If he can develop a skill for reading pro coverage and win one-on-one with 
option routes and two-way-goes, Watson could develop into a high-volume NFL receiver from the backfield who also earns 
playing time as a detached receiver.  
Watson is a sleeper worth monitoring during the draft cycle. His 2023 production and performances and all-star game and 
pre-draft workouts could elevate his draft capital to a place where early playing time in the NFL might become an 
expectation (Bernard/McCaffrey) rather than a surprise (Ekeler).  
The most likely outcome is Watson is a mid-range pick like Aaron Jones (5th round) whose draft capital is just high enough 
to earn a legitimate shot at contributing early in his career. 
What is the best scheme fit? Anywhere he’s given a chance to become an all-purpose weapon as opposed to a situational 
passing-down role player. There isn’t a team that comes to mind where this will be a priority. As is the case with most backs 
of Watson’s archetype, a heavy role will be more of a happy accident than an expectation.  
What is his ceiling scenario? Austin Ekeler’s run with the Chargers if Watson proves capable between the tackles in the 
NFL. More likely, it will be Gio Bernard’s run with the Bengals where he could do more if called upon but won’t be.  
What is his floor scenario? Jalen Richard or Chase Edmonds as a role player and journeyman.  
Physical Linebackers and safeties can generate a push against him in pass protection and walk him into the pocket. He 
breaks a lot of tackles in the flats because of his stiff-arm as well as his ability to lift his knees and feet high through lower-
body wraps.  
Technical: He can lose assignments off the edge against defensive backs when he’s passive at the point of attack and 
catches contact rather than delivering a punch.  


Text from page 277:
 
89 
Conceptual: Watson is a willing tight-crease runner who can bleed yardage on plays that don’t look productive for college 
football but are considered well-blocked in the NFL.  
Intuitive: He’s also good at gauging when to accelerate as he’s approaching the crease at a slower pace. 
Build: Average-sized scat back.  
Vision: Watson reads the leverage of defenders on runs between the tackles, presses the line within a step of his linemen 
on zone blocking, and finds the bounce lane.  
When running power, Watson works from the puller’s inside shoulder to the outside shoulder as a way of setting up the 
block and slowing down the pursuit of a linebacker between the tackles. He’s a willing tight-crease runner who can bleed 
yardage.  
Watson identifies penetration into the backfield as he’s taking the exchange and has efficient solutions to avoid the 
opponent. He also identifies interior run blitzes pre-snap.  
Watson presses the inside double-team on Duo and works his way to the outside based on the leverage of opponents on his 
blocks.  
Watson is effective at setting up defensive linemen in the crease with pressures on Power and Trap. He’ll read the leverage 
and press toward the defender’s favorable leverage before bouncing into the next lane over where the blocker has the 
leverage over that defender.  
Watson will attempt cutbacks and bounces, but he identifies edge containment quick enough to get back inside when 
needed. He’s also good at gauging when to accelerate as he’s approaching the crease at a slower pace.  
In the open field, Watson will set up the safety behind a blocked linebacker to press that safety in the wrong direction 
before working around him to open grass.  
Elusiveness: Watson has sharp pressure cuts and can execute them in succession in opposite directions from one another. 
He opens his hips with economy to bounce away from interior penetration.  
Watson can also execute tight turns with his hips off sharp stop-start movement to force linebackers to overrun pursuit 
angles. He has a hard stick that works well to set up a defender in front of him before cutting back or bouncing away.  
Watson understands how to adjust his stride length and pace to set up Counter—even when penetration off the play-side 
edge slows the progress of pullers and has them stuck in the backfield. He uses pace changes well to set up Duo, too. He 
can cut his stride at the edge of a crease while staying tight to the back of a blocker. 
Watson combines pace and stride changes when he uses a stutter to bait a safety in the wrong direction from 10 yards 
away so he has more open grass to roam. He can even press inside and across the back of the block with depth and still get 
back outside.  
He can slide across the face of pursuit over the top with jump-cuts and get his heel high to his back side to avoid reaches 
for his lower legs.  
He’ll use a spin to the inside when near the boundary.  
He can transition downhill from a sideline approach inside the box with maybe one step but it’s when he’s not moving a high 
rate of speed, so I need to see more. He only needed two short steps to the near side edge.  
He has quick and narrow jump-cut to avoid penetrating linebackers in the backfield.  
Acceleration: Watson has the acceleration to get outside to the near-side edge on a well-blocked run, beating box 
defenders and working up the boundary until defensive backs arrive in pursuit.  
He accelerates past backside pursuit from linebackers in the open field. He can also beat safeties in the box as well as 
safeties coming downhill from the same side as the hole.  
His burst is better than it appears at first. His acceleration has a gliding quality.  


Text from page 278:
 
90 
Speed: Once in the open field, he can pull away from a cornerback on the same side of the field who has an angle on him 
from 3-5 yards and extend that lead as he continues 40 yards up the boundary. He can maintain his speed for 55-65 yards 
and still beat the back side corner to the end zone. 
Power: Watson is not a tackle breaker without momentum on his side. He will lower the shoulder and deliver a forearm into 
an oncoming defender, taking only one side of the defender so he has a chance to work through the contact. He will keep 
his feet moving and drag defensive ends downfield 3-4 yards when he has momentum.  
Watson has a capable stiff-arm to ward off reaches from defenders as he works around the edge. He has excellent 
placement with the stiff-arm against safeties at the edge and he can deliver it with violence and follow up with movement of 
the arm to chop the reach the defender.  
He breaks a lot of tackles in the flats because of his stiff-arm as well as his ability to lift his knees and feet high through 
lower-body wraps.  
Direct Contact Balance: Watson can stalemate a hit from a defensive lineman at the entrance of a crease if they hit is 
high, his pads are low, and he’s the only one of the two with momentum heading into the contact. He can bounce off direct 
contact to the chest with momentum from a safety-sized defensive back head-on when he also has momentum.  
Indirect Contact Balance: Watson drops his pads and bounces off indirect contact from safeties at the end of a crease. He 
can bounce off light contact from a linebacker hitting his pads in the hole. He also bounces off defensive linemen in the hole 
if he’s the one with the momentum and the lineman has little to none.  
Watson has an effective balance-touch technique to recover from slips or losses of balance.  
Routes: Watson works to depth on routes leaking from the backfield and snaps his turns at his breaks to create a square 
position to the quarterback into the open spot of the underneath zone. When running vertical routes against zone coverage, 
Watson tempos his breaks so he doesn’t run into the defender in the next zone over.  
He has an effective one-step-stretch against off-man coverage. He’ll use a wipe to counter the reach of a defender.  
Receiving: Watson catches targets at chest level with overhand position away from his frame. He uses underhand position 
when the target is at his waist. He understands which attack to use based on the trajectory of the ball and keeps his feet on 
the ground when the target doesn’t require him to jump.  
He transitions downhill with tight turns of his hips that can force linebackers and safeties to overrun their pursuit angles.  
Watson tracks the ball well. He can adjust to targets thrown behind his break path, including targets thrown completely 
behind him on wide routes and the ball arrives with more velocity than necessary. He can extend fully with his arms on 
targets thrown behind his break path to earn the ball.  
He tracks the ball over his shoulder and uses underhand position effectively and he can take a hit to his chest after he 
secures the ball.  
He has a skilled jump-though on sideline fades, high-points with excellent attack, and drags the foot at the boundary while 
executing the pull-down away from the trialing coverage.  
He also embraces the fall effectively as he returns to the ground and takes contact to his back from the tight coverage 
trailing him.  
Watson can catch a target at his back hip while crossing the width of the field and transition downhill into a defender’s hit of 
his chest in bang-bang fashion and maintain possession of the ball.   
Blocking: Watson identifies A- and B-Gap pressure, squares his target, and cuts across and through the legs of his 
opponent in timely fashion. He earns enough high with his cut blocking and keeps his head up. Watson can also square a 
linebacker and shoot directly through the legs of a defender.  
Watson will help with double teams against interior linemen. He earns a square position and extends his hands. He’ll also 
peel outside and deliver a late shot to the blitzing edge defender to force the opponent away from the quarterback.  


Text from page 279:
 
91 
He extends well at helmet level and above with overhand technique while wrapped at his back by a linebacker in tight 
coverage on angle routes.  
He delivers an uppercut to the chest of an edge defender when helping as a double-teamer. He’ll earn a chest-to-pads 
position against edge pressure with a wide stance, but he overextends with his frame and this can limit the opportunity to 
deliver a punch. 
Watson will pick up the tackle or the end on a T-E twist. He punches with his forearms and uppercuts through the motion, 
but also overextends into the contact. When he has lapses with punches, he leads with his shoulders or head in these 
scenarios to cut off the defender.  
Watson delivers a chip with impact on edge defenders but not so hard that he’s knocking them off the primary blocker.  
He can lose assignments off the edge against defensive backs when he’s passive at the point of attack and catches contact 
rather than delivering a punch. Linebackers and safeties can generate a push against him and walk him into the pocket.  
Ball Security: Watson carries the ball high and tight to his frame. He can take a hit to the ball and maintain possession. He 
uses the boundary-side arm based on the design of the play. Watson can have lapses where the elbow is loose from his 
frame in the open field.  
Durability: No significant injuries.  
 
Pre-NFL Draft Fantasy Advice: Watson’s routes aren’t on par with Will Shipley and Dylan Laube, but he has superior 
hands and has as much if not more promise as a runner. He’s one of those picks you can get in rounds 3-5—and likely on 
the lower end of that spectrum—before the NFL draft who could present value in a year or two.
